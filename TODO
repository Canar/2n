Possible improvements / approaches / techniques:
dr_flac - small flac decoder - https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs
pipe / exec dox - https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~holzmann/C/system/pipeforkexec.html

poll implementation
 - write considering PIPE_BUF <limits.h>
 - pipe2 with o_nonblock (saves fcntl call)
 - fds:
	audio playback, stdin
		audio decode assumed to be always readable(?)
	future: playlist change notif
		windows uses callback to write inotify-style update?
